Note:
If you experience any lag, I've marked a few sprites that you can completely comment out (I put them in for appearence for things like the background).
The game shouldn't lag (it seems to run well on my computer, but it slowed down a bit on the school computers), but if there is any lag, comment out these sprites/actors and it should run great (the program seems to really hate having too many actors on the screen for some reason).
