Made by: Action

Made this a while ago.
 
Note:
If you experience any lag, I've marked a few sprites that you can completely comment out (I put them in for appearance for things like the background).
The game shouldn't lag (it runs well on my computer, but it slowed down a bit on older computers). If there is any lag, comment out these sprites/actors and it should run great (the library seems to really hate having too many actors on the screen).

The artwork was not made by me, it's from some really great artists that share their work for free.
